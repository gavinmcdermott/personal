            <p>
              I've been a founding engineer, grown development teams, and written software that processed billions in transactions. <i>I'm not an engineer</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've crafted products used by milions and lead design workshops in foreign countries. <i>I'm not a designer</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>I exist at the intersection of intuition and application.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              And I'd always had a curiosity relating to my tools of choice; so I did a historical dive. And I came to realize, however late in my career it was, something important. I realized that we're all awash in a medium that <a class="theme-4" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6orsmFndx_o" target="_blank">forgot its own history</a> -- and I have a sense that something important is being lost.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Regaining it will take more than algorithms and advertising.</strong>
            </p>  
            <p>
              So it's time for a new path. And it will take a little looking backward <span class="f--super">[1]</span> to go forward. It will also involve some <a class="theme-4" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o" target="_blank">Wayne Gretzky</a>, lots of showing by doing, and synthesis paired with original thought. 
            </p>
            <p>
              All of this, driven by a deep intent to contribute to, and build upon, the work of giants.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is still the beginning of our technology-augmented world; infancy <span class="f--super">[2]</span>. And <a class="theme-4" href="https://vimeo.com/67076984" target="_blank">someone once told me</a> that we can use this magic media, a little lost knowledge, and things not yet known, to think the unthinkable. To create a world we could only once imagine.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>This is why I create.</strong>
